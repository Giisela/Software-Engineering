# Software-Engineering
The main objective was to create a mobile application that converts colors into representative symbols for colorblind people. For this, several micro programs were used, such as Docker, Jenkins, python and databases, so that it was possible to establish communication with all components, placing images and videos with the symbols of a certain color. 

This project is incomplete since the color system has a varied color range, and the symbols for color blind people are very limited.
